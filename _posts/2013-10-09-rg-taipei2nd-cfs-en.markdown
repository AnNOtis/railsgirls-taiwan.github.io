title: "Rails Girls Taipei 2nd Workshop Call For Sponsors"
---

Dear all, we are organizing the second Rails Girls workshop in Taipei on November.

## Briefly About Rails Girls

Rails Girls is a two-day non-profit event for women of all ages to give them a great first experience in software craftsmanship. We aim to give the tools to understand technology along with the community and inspiration to get started.

Rails Girls is not just about programming, it's about building things. During the workshop, our coaches will lead 1 to 3 students. From the very beginning to a minimum web application, yet still functional.

## Rails Girls Community

Rails Girls was founded by Linda Liukas and Karri Saarinen in the end of 2010 in Helsinki, Finland. Rails Girls aims to unlock the technology world and make it more approachable for women of all age. The first Rails Girls workshop was held in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. Since then, the workshop have expanded to 60 cities all over the world, more than 120 events!

On September 2013. Rails Girls comes to Taipei! Thanks to veryWed's sponsorship, we've successfully organized the very first Rails Girls workshop in Taipei. Got over [320+ interested girls](http://registrano.com/events/railsgirls-taipei-01) have signed-up for the workshop in just 2 days. After some tough decision, we pick 30 students and 15 coaches and made our very first workshop. It was a great adventure with joy. See [the feedback from students, coaches, and media](/2013/10/08/rg-taipei1st-record).
